    <h1>choose ur snack</h1>
    <p>I love eating a burger which is filled with cheese and vegetables. The more vegetables you add, the better it tastes. My personal favourite is lettuce. It gives the burger the right amount of freshness and crunchiness.DOCTYPE tells the browser which version of HTML the document is in. And the html element represents the root element which contains all other elements.</p>
